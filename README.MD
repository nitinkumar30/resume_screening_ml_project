# Errors/Warnings

1. I was getting error in nltk to download some missing files. Just add ```nltk.download('punkt')``` after importing the nltk to download those missing files.
2. I installed "wordcloud" from anaconda but it was giving me 'module not found' error. I've followed below steps:  
    I. First check which python you're using by typing   
    ```import sys```  
    ```print(sys.executable```   
    in anaconda console  
    II. and then ```path_to_python -m pip install wordcloud```  

# Tool used

> I've completed this project in Anaconda IDLE but you may refer to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). They both are almost same.

# Dataset

> I've used a pre-defined dataset which I've got in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dhainjeamita/updatedresumedataset/download).
